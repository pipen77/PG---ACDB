Early in the next millennium your right and left cuff links
or earrings may communicate with each other by low-orbiting
satellites and have more computer power than your present PC.
Your telephone won't ring indiscriminately; it will receive, son,
and perhaps respond to your incoming calls like a well-trained
English butler. Mass media will be redefined by systems for
transmitting and receiving personalized information and entertainment.
Schools will change to become more like museums
and playgrounds for children to assemble ideas and socialize
with other children all over the world. The digital planet will
look and feel like the head of a pin.
